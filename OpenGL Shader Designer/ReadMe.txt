This program is released as freeware to support the OpenGl community. We encourage people that write shaders to share the source to help others gain knowledge and experience with glsl. We'll make a shader section at our website where people can share their own work and study others.


If you encounter any bugs, check the bugs.txt file to see if the issue is known. If it's not, please send a bug report to bugreport@typhoonlabs.com. Feature suggestions are also appreciated.
