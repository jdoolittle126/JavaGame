Changes since July 2004 Release
-------------------------------
- Structures when initialized both as a constant and a non constant were broken.

Changes Since Apr 2004 Release
-------------------------------
- Added support for #extension and #version preprocessor directives.
- Removed printf statements and instead dump messages on InfoSink.
- Most of the source code is now thread safe except for some of the preprocessor code. Also For Linux, the per thread data clean up is yet to be implemented as it is not exactly known when the thread exits.
- Fixed comma operator when used with constant initializer.
- Added folding when constructors are called with constant values.
- Correctly updated builtIn names for texture functions from texture{1|2}DShadow[Proj][Lod] to shadow{1|2}D[Proj][Lod].
- Updated the built-in constant names as per latest GL2 specs.
- Portable across more platforms.

Please feel free to submit any fixes to the parser code.

Changes Since Oct 2003 Release
-------------------------------
- Added new reserved keywords.  Also reserved %=.
- Fixed some bugs and memory leaks in the preprocessor.
- Fixed name mangling for function names.  Names also now include array sizes.
- Fixed implementation of unsized arrays.
- Constructors: Disallow matrices constructed from matrices, and unused arguments.
   Also fixed some cases like float(vec2) that were not working right.
- TILDA -> TILDE.
- Fixed structure qualifier semantics:  they apply to variables declared, not the structure definition.


Changes since May 2003 Release
-------------------------------

- Corrected some bugs in preprocessor.
- Keeping track of maximum size of the array used in the source code.
- Parameter passing during function call and keeping track of inout and out parameters.
- Added some more built in functions.
- Portability to Linux


Changes Since April 2002 Release
--------------------------------

* Semantic changes to bring the implementation and spec closer together,
  and support issue resolution.

* Some minor functionality completeness.  

  - User function calls are more complete, 
  - added the ^^ operator (logical exclusive or)
  - fixed variable scoping in if-else
  - no declarations in if-conditions
  - improved typing of field selectors
  - removed suffixes from literal constants
  - many smaller semantic changes to be in line with the current spec
  - added preprocessor
  - added non-scalar constants
  - added structures

Changes since July 2002 Release
-------------------------------

Brought up to date with version 1.051 of the OpenGL Shading Language 
Specification.  It is now almost complete.  The list of detailed 
changes would be long, as the specification has changed extensively, 
and all missing functionality has been added.
