			Shader Designer Version 1.5.9.4
			-------------------------------
* Fixed bug that causes a crash with certain 3D cards when generate AVI file when using the 
  Automatic motion mode.
* Automatic motion will show the rendered frames while it is rendering them, like in the manual 
  mode.
* Added an option in the settings dialog to disable GL_POINT_SMOOTH. Enabling this will cause
  that ATI cards doesn't update correctly the uniform variables values. (this is a temporary
  fix until ATI fix this bug in their driver). The configuration of this option is stored in 
  the settings.xml file.

			Shader Designer Version 1.5.9.3
			-------------------------------
* Fixed many little issues


			Shader Designer Version 1.5.9.2
			-------------------------------
* Fixed some low-importance OpenGL startup errors.
* Fixed crash at exit on NV cards.

			Shader Designer Version 1.5.9.1
			-------------------------------
* Fixed a bug related with cubemaps
* Added project compatibility with older version
* Because Meshmender plugin won't be used anymore, Shader Designer will ignore it if 
  appears in the project file, to avoid posible plugins names's colisions


			Shader Designer Version 1.5.9
			-----------------------------
* Fixed a bug with the textures dialog that caused the textures to dissapear when clicking 
  Refresh Textures button
* Updated projects to do not use the meshmender plugin for tangents and binormals. Now the gsd meshes
  carries this information (the updated 3DSmax5 plugin to generate these new meshes will be released soon)
  Now Shader Designer always provides tangents and binormals automatically (attribute vec3 tangent and
  attribute vec3 binormal) 

	------ USING THE MESHMENDER PLUGIN MAY CAUSE AN ERROR. DO NOT USE IT ANYMORE --------

* Updated all meshes to have tangents and binormals information (These changes in the meshes have
  introduced an incompatibility with older meshes)
* TopMost style had been removed from the Splash screen.
* Updated to last version of OpenIL.
* Removed tutorials (there will be new tutorials soon)



			Shader Designer Version 1.5.8.1
			-------------------------------
* Fixed a stupid bug introduced in version 1.5.8 that keep statics light position spheres in the
  preview view   
* Added a CAMERA_POSITION predefined uniform variable (useful for specular effect, or any other
  view dependant effect)



			Shader Designer Version 1.5.8
			-----------------------------
* Fixed to work with OpenGL 2.0 drivers
* Fixed ortho mode. Now texture coordinates are generated even if there isn't any texture in the project.
* Improve cleaning code. Now there is not any known leak.
* Dbl-click over a .gdp file will open the Shader Designer and load the project.
* Now .gdp paths are stored relative to the .gdp folder instead of to the shaderdesigner.exe folder.
* Both  (.gdp and .exe) relative paths are accepted when the Shader Designer loads a project, but only will 
  save .gdl relative files (these last two points are made to maintain compatibility with Linux version of the 
  Shader Designer project files)
* Improved code folding. Now #ifdef - #endif and #if - #endif has folding capabilities (like #region in C#)


			Shader Designer Version 1.5.7
			-----------------------------
 * Updated the code box, now it will refresh well between tab clicks
 * Changed rendering code, now light positions are passed to the vertex shader in world space 
   (for lights, modelview = identity)
 * Added a shortcut to "Disable shader rendering" menú (CTRL + D)
 * Updated the 3Dlabs generic glsl compiler to latest version.
 * Fixed some functionalities in the uniform dialog.



			Shader Designer Version 1.5.6
			-----------------------------
 * Added more meshes to the Shader Designer (they are placed into resources folder)
 * Improved interface to handle multiple meshes more easyly
 * Fixed a bug that applies the polygonBack fill mode to front faces
 * rearranged some items in the property grid (now clamp value is in the alpha section)
 * Fixed a bug that causes an exception in the textures dialog when the texture target field is 
   changed once the texture has been loaded. Now the texture becomes invalid instead of the    exception
 * Fixed a mistake that allows the user to open the texture load dialog when double clicks on a 
   texture unit that hasn't been activated



			Shader Designer Version 1.5.5
			-----------------------------
 * Updated software GLSL compiler to last version
 * Fixed a bug in AVI export that keeps the moving light stationary.
 * Fixed the background textures path in the project file, now they are relatives.
 * Fixed all projects with background to reflect the relative paths.
 * Fixed some IDE icons that doesn't appeared.
 * Fixed a issue that causes a bad repaint of the textures preview pane.


			Shader Designer Version 1.5.4
			-----------------------------
 * Some IDE checkings at uniforms dialog and textures dialog.
 * Improved the AVI export code.
 * Fixed INT slide widget bars. Now increases with discrete incrementes, not decimal.


			Shader Designer Version 1.5.3
			-----------------------------
 * Added live video to the avi export (user can rotate/zoom/pan the camera, while video is
   recording)


			Shader Designer Version 1.5.2
			-----------------------------

 * Fixed a bug intextures dialog, now remembers all texture parameters after exiting
 * Added AVI video exportation feature (you can choose camera speed, distance to (0,0,0)
   resolution, fps, duration, and any video codec installed in your system)
 * Updated offline compilation with the last GLSL 3DLabs compiler release.
 * Added a new init check. If desktop has less than 32 color bits, Shader Designer won't start.

			Shader Designer Version 1.5
			---------------------------
 * Changed general UI, now all are into sliding panels, with the posibility 
   make them floating windows.
 * Supressed uniform buttons (add, modify and remove), now these functions
   are avalaibles throught contextual popup menu (right click over uniforms
   window
 * Added a non-interactive textures preview panel to the main window
 * Improved resource management
 * New menu arrangement (menu settings)
 * Added widgets for uniform variables (slide bar and color slide bar)
 * Included a new textures plugin: procedural 3d textures (for noise3d, lightmaps, etc)
 * Removed idegraph folder
 * Added Fog parameters to the lighting property grid
 * Added software compilation capacity
 * The sofware compilation has the capacity of showing the intermediate code compiled
 * Add a new compilation window for software compilation output
 * Double click on the generic compilation window shows the line with the error in the code 
   (yellow color)
 * Added a new dialog who stores some IDE settings
 * Fixed a bug that locked the ctrl key after return from textures dialog (accessed throught ctrl+t)
   and casues a panning motion instead a rotation with the preview window


			Shader Designer Version 1.4.4
			-----------------------------
 * Fixed a bug that causes a stakoverflow error on the textures dialog
 * Improved textures plugin system


			Shader Designer Version 1.4.3
			-----------------------------
 * Fixed a bug that causes a exception when all shader files are closed
 * Fixed shaders from "shaders" folder. Now some shaders has some kind of animation
 * Added more shaders to "shaders" folder, like mandelbrot, julia, adapatativeAA, stripes...


			Shader Designer Version 1.4.2
			-----------------------------
 * Fixed validation of texture plugins, now works fine
 * New files created when click "New Shader Project" now have this text: "void main(){ };"

 * Fixed some issues when loading projects
 * Add more information to the error message if a load project process fail
 * Enabled GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE_ARB for the vertex shader
 * Control + left click  (dragging) in the preview/fullscreen moves the view vector 
   of the camera 
 * Added parallax bump mapping shader in the shader folder (bump.gdp). Thanks to yooyo
 * Added a new version of the meshmender plugin in the website (www.typhoonlabs.com)
   Thanks to yooyo again :)


			Shader Designer Version 1.4
			---------------------------

 * Fixed textures management, now the avalaible textures are
    GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS_ARB instead of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS 
   (with this, gffx cards has 16 avalaible textures, instead only 4)
 * Added arrow two buttons in the textures preview to go up and down throught
   the pages
 * Added screenshot functionality in fullscreen mode throught F2 key
 * Textures panel: dbl click into a texture to open the right openfile dialog
