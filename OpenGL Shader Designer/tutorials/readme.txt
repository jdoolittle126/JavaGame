openGL Shader Designer tutorials
www.typhoonlabs.com

These tutorials are based on the usage of the openGL Shader Designer found at www.typhoonlabs.com. It is a IDE with all the tools and functions required for developing vertex and fragment ( pixel ) shaders. All shaders will be developed in that IDE, but a host application framework will also be available soon. 

The openGL Shader Designer is distributed as freeware at www.typhoonlabs.com.

I hope that the information in these tutorials will give good starting point for those that are beginning glsl. I've done my best to ensure that they are bug free and easy to follow. Any issues and feedback will be greatly appreciated. Mail comments and suggestion to eirikhm@typhoonlabs.com
